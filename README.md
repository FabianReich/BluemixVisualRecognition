# BluemixVisualRecognition
If you have an educational or test license for the Bluemix platform then you can only create 1 classifier at a time. This project is helping you to coup with that, by providing functionality for pragmatically remove and recreate a classifier with different training data.

For this to work on your platform, you have to change some code:

 1. <b>Replace</b> the text: < Your-API-Key> with your <b>API Key</b>.

 2. <b>Add the positive and negative examples</b> for the classifier.
 
 3. You can also change the classifier name. (Optional)
